ESCAPE FROM THE BOZO DIMENSION (Working title)

Attempt to doodle with 3D godot in a FPS style.

So far there is a stamina system which drains if you toggle running or attack, you can attack with no stamina but it stops you from running. The powerups are supposed to have different effects depending on the weapon you use but there is only one weapon so far. Made a couple navmesh-less enemies with some I think interesting emergent properties. I invite anyone who has access to play around with what I have or make a level or something if they can figure out my stuff.

The default level has portals that lead to other test levels.

As it stands, controls are:

WASD to move
Q to switch equipment (Only 'no weapons' and 'knife' have been implemented)
LMB to attack (RMB will be implemented as alt fire later)
Space to Jump
Shift to Toggle Sprint
F to use Bingo Bean
Tab to capture/uncapture mouse 
Esc to quit
